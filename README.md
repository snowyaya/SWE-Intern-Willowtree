Each one of these objects is meant to be separate from the other, and each fulfills a specific role. When building an app that uses a specific pattern, in this case MVC, the goal is to adhere to the pattern when building all layers of your app.

**Concepts**

[Code Smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell)

[Good Engineering Principles - SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
>The SOLID ideas are
>The **single-responsibility** principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."[5] In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.[6]
>The **open–closed** principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."[7]
>The **Liskov substitution** principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."[8] See also design by contract.[8]
>The **interface segregation** principle: "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."[9][4]
>The **dependency inversion** principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."[10][4]
>The SOLID acronym was introduced later, around 2004, by Michael Feathers.[11]
